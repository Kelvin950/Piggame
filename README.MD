After completing a javascript course on udemy I  went through socket.io docs to learn how to change a specific project i worked on in the javascript course i took. The project was about a game called pig game which involved two players rolling a dice. A player loses point when a one is rolled. I decided to change the game to an online  multiplayer game and introduce more functionalities like sending messages  and invitations as well. I also introduced avatars for each player.
Below are some screenshot.
